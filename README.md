# Machine Learning for Trading

This repository demonstrates how to use machine learning for trading with Bitcoin price data. The approach leverages predictive modeling to generate trading signals based on historical price movements.

## Features
- Data preprocessing using Pandas
- Feature engineering for trading signals
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Backtesting strategy performance
- Visualization of model predictions

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model and evaluate the strategy:

```bash
jupyter notebook Bitcoin_machine_learning_strategy.ipynb
```

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib yfinance vectorbt
```

## Results
The notebook includes:
- Data visualization for better insight into price trends
- Model accuracy evaluation
- Backtest results showing profitability
